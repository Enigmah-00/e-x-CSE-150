Description:
...
Dot Connector is a mind-bending and captivating puzzle game designed to be played between two opponents. 
It challenges their intellect, patience, and logical abilities. Each opponent is presented with a screen filled with 
dots, and their objective is to strategically connect the dots, create square cycles, and dominate the board.
With every move, players exert pressure on their opponents to make more squares quickly and with the 
fewest possible moves.
CONTROL:
The game presents a 5x5 grid of empty nodes. Players are tasked with connecting edges between two nodes in a single 
move by inputting the matrix representations of the nodes they wish to connect. It is prohibited to overwrite an existing 
edge, and edges can only be drawn vertically or horizontallyâ€”diagonal edges are not allowed. 
When a player successfully forms a square of 1 square unit, they earn an extra move and a point. The game concludes 
once all nodes are visited. The winner is determined by comparing the scores of "Player 1" and "Player 2" with the 
player scoring the most points declared as the winner.
Gameplay:
A player will join through a desktop/mobile. If the player wants to initiate a new game, they will click on "NEW GAME" 
and then click "PLAY" to start the game. Two players can participate in the game: Player 1 can invite Player 2, and if 
Player 2 accepts the invitation, they can play the game together. Alternatively, there is an option for an offline game 
where both players can play using a single device.
In this game, each player must connect the dots. If a player can create a square of one square unit using the dots, they 
will earn an additional move also a point. This process continues until there are no possible edges left. The game 
concludes when there are no more opportunities to create squares. The player who can make the most squares of one 
square unit using the dots will be declared the winner.
Goal: 
The player's objective is to connect the dots and create cycles. At the end of the game, the player with the highest 
number of squares in their domination will emerge victorious. Points are awarded for every square created, and the 
player with the highest point total will be declared the winner.
Development Goal:
Elevate player engagement and strategic depth in "Dot Connector" by introducing an online multiplayer mode with 
cross-platform compatibility. Implement a dynamic scoring system based on square sizes, ensuring a challenging yet 
rewarding gameplay experience. Enhance the game's visual appeal through an intuitive interface. The ultimate goal is to 
provide a seamless and competitive gaming experience, fostering strategic thinking and healthy competition across 
different devices. As part of future enhancements, explore the possibility of accommodating more than two players 
simultaneously, expanding the game's social and competitive aspects.
